## Ingress for Master and DJ

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: tcp-services
  namespace: ingress-nginx
data:
  8001: "radio/liquidsoap:8001"
  8002: "radio/liquidsoap:8002"
```

### Example

```text
The next example shows how to expose the service example-go running in the namespace default in the port 8080 using the port 9000
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: tcp-services
  namespace: ingress-nginx
data:
  9000: "default/example-go:8080"
```

```Then, the config map should be added to the ingress controllerâ€™s deployment args.

args:
    - /nginx-ingress-controller
    - --tcp-services-configmap=ingress-nginx/tcp-services
```
