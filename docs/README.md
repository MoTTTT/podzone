# Introduction to the PodZone project

This micro-site contains documentation including the requirements, specification, design, and build notes for the technology research, development, test and build of a kubernetes cluster, and migrating a workload from older technologies.

## Technology decisions

While lifecycle cost considerations would typically guide the selection of components for a solution, the architecture was chosen to gain exposure to current technologies, the timelines and effort regarded as learning investment.

Lifecycle costs have however been applied to selection of external services, with a preference for consuming on-prem services where reasonable.

## Learning goals

- Build confidence in deploying, troubleshooting and consuming Kubernetes
- Apply declarative processes for the platform and service provisioning (IoC)
- Documenting a "Consumer Cloud" case study
