# Hardware Selection

From a mail to a friend:

I looked at 2nd hand PowerEdge servers. The issue is the hard drive caddys. Most of the PowerEdge servers I have seen second hand has had the HD caddy stripped.
The HD caddy makes the drives hot-swappable, and is expensive, only used in enterprise gear. 
If you look at this deal for example: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/225945684989, it all looks good until you notice there are no RAM, HDs or caddys.

I went for the HP thin client for the following reasons:
- form factor
- low noise
- DDR4 RAM up to 64GB (poweredge is DDR3)
- 4 CPU Cores (poweredge has 2 X 4 core CPUs)
- 2.2GHz CPU  (poweredge is around here as well, depending on model)
- 2 X m.2 SATA SSD slots (poweredge uses SAS disks, good but expensive)

With 3 units, you get a 12 Core cluster, up to 96 GB RAM, and 6 X M.2 SATA slots for distributed storage.
