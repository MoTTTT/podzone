# podzone

Documentation on the southern.podzone.net implementation.

The site is intended to serve from <https://docs.podzone.net/>.

The content is written in markdown (which can be found in the docs/ directory), and rendered using mkdocs.

It is served from an on-prem kubernetes cluster, fetching updates from GitHub.
